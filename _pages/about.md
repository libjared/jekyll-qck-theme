I am a computer science student at IPFW, with experience in all sorts of different topics, languages, libraries, algorithms, and technologies. A subset of these are listed below. Click on one for a list of all projects/blog posts that concern each (if applicable).

* [C#](/search/?t=csharp)
* Java
* Lua
* C
* [Python](/search/?t=python)
* Z80 Assembly
* x86 Assembly
* [JavaScript](/search/?t=javascript)
* Bash

Some projects I haven't written about yet:

* I was a programmer (and sometimes engineer) for one of many VEX robotics teams from Zionsville High School. Lots of techniques were invented there, but I was most proud of the original use of jumper clips for "DIP switches". They allowed the operator to toggle between a number of autonomous sequences without having to recode, recompile, or redownload, which isn't possible in such a time-critical situation.
* A representative from a popular online gaming community contracted me to build a server application that would check for new donations and reward community players based on the amount given.
* A friend, Jordan, and I set out to make a multiplayer game, with no more direction than that. Project Ares is still in development.
    * I know how multiplayer games work, but had never programmed it myself. Jordan, a friend of mine, suggested we work on a game together. The development is slow, but consistent. Jordan works on the majority of the client and assets while I do the server plus some of the more difficult client stuff. We both collaborate towards what we want the game to play like, and our ideas flow fast.
    * C# is my favorite language. [SFML.NET](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) handles the client drawing, and [Lidgren](https://code.google.com/p/lidgren-network-gen3/) simplifies the networking. My primary OS is Linux Mint, while my home server and Jordan's laptop are both Windows. As a result, I have to make execuatables that work with both. The <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono project</a> has made this easy.
